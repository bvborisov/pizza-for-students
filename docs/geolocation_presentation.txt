leafletjs.com
 - Easy to use 
 - Lightweight

 - Small amount of detail - data can be shifted

openlayers.org
 - Heavyweight
 - Not as easy to use
 - Flexible!
 - Customizable
 - Different overlays(campus maps, POIs, etc)

Considerations
- Google, etc. have caps!
- Hosted or donwloaded?
- Projection and conversion
 - Kartograph
 - APIs tend to use Web Mercator
 - If need conversion contact edina! - eg. British National Grid conversion usually introduces error. Not a problem for cities, but buildings can be moved eg. 20-30 meters.
